# Visualizing-Road-Accident-in-India.
India has one of the largest road networks in the world. However, Road safety is still an issue of national concern. The data was extracted from Indian Govt official website and was cleaned and processed using BigQuery in Google Cloud Platform.  I tried to visualize multiple dimensions and magnitude of road accidents in India using Tableau. The Visualization will help to create awareness and decision making in the area of road safety. I hope, this interactive visualization would be useful for policy makers, citizens, and civil society organizations working in areas that have an influence on road safety.
